<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Increasing access to large individual and spatial datasets and greater computing power have encouraged the development of statistical analysis tools for processing such data in the best possible way <span class="citation">(Baddeley et al., 2016)</span>.
Empirical studies at very fine geographical levels have thus been proposed in recent years for large datasets.
Particular attention has been paid to detect the spatial structures (attraction, repulsion, independence) of individual spatialised data using analyses that are no longer based on zoned data but on geolocalised data.
This type of approach has the advantage of preserving the exact positions of the entities analysed.
It has been proven that any distance-based method (by considering space as continuous) circumvents statistical bias associated with to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem – MAUP <span class="citation">(Arbia, 1989; Openshaw &amp; Taylor, 1979)</span> due to discretising space into separate units.
Various studies have shown how important it is to use this type of methodology in many fields, including geography <span class="citation">(Deurloo &amp; De Vos, 2008; Sweeney &amp; Feser, 1998; <strong>Kukuliac2017?</strong>)</span>, economics <span class="citation">(Arbia, 1989; Marcon &amp; Puech, 2003)</span>, ecology <span class="citation">(Cressie, 1993; Lentz et al., 2011)</span>, biology <span class="citation">(Dray et al., 2021)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>In a recent article, <span class="citation">Tidu et al. (2024)</span> highlight the interest of a particular statistical measure, the <em>M</em> function proposed by <span class="citation">Marcon &amp; Puech (2010)</span>.
This measure, which we will refer to as <em>M</em> in the remainder of the article, makes it possible to highlight spatial structures within a spatialised distribution (attraction, repulsion, independence) from a study based on the distances separating the entities analysed.
However, while this measure preserves all the richness of individual geolocated data, it requires a longer calculation time than other distance-based measures, since it is both a cumulative and relative measure <!--# Eric: je ne suis pas sûr que 'cumulatif' soit pertinent. Le temps de calcul plus long est du à la prise en compte de deux distributions -> 'relatif', mais pas au cumul --> <span class="citation">(see Marcon &amp; Puech, 2017 for a literature review on the advantages and limitations of a dozen existing distance-based measures)</span>.
<span class="citation">Tidu et al. (2024)</span> propose to limit <em>M</em> calculation times by introducing a voluntary positioning error for the entities analysed.
For example, in their study, industrial establishments in Sardinia (Italy) are no longer located at their exact postal address but at the centroid of their municipality.
This repositioning reduces calculation times, as the number of possible distances between establishments is in fact limited to the distances separating the centroids of the municipalities.
This approach is similar to that of <span class="citation">Scholl &amp; Brenner (2015)</span> who proposed, for the <span class="math inline">\(K_d\)</span> function <span class="citation">(Duranton &amp; Overman, 2005)</span> which characterises spatial structures using another method, to approximate the distances between pairs of entities by grouping them into classes.
The method of <span class="citation">Scholl &amp; Brenner (2015)</span>, implemented in the <em>dbmss</em> package <span class="citation">(Marcon et al., 2015)</span> for R <span class="citation">(R Core Team, 2024)</span> provides a considerable gain in computational performance with little loss of accuracy.
On the other hand, the information loss due to the approximation of the location of objects should imply a loss of accuracy in the estimation of their interactions at the same scale, that must be assessed.</p>
<p>In our paper, we propose to test the effectiveness of <span class="citation">Tidu et al. (2024)</span>’s method and help the researchers to choose the appropriate method to characterise the spatial structure of quite large datasets.
First, we show the advantages of using the <em>dbmss</em> package to estimate the <em>M</em> function on datasets with an order of magnitude of 100,000 points or less, and we show that the computation times become excessive beyond that, on a personal computer.
We then study the effect of the geographical approximation of the locations of the entities analysed.
This methodological work, based on a deliberately limited number of entity locations, enables us to quantify the extent of the deterioration in information that this approach creates.
These performance tests provide a precise answer to the computational advantages and limitations of the <em>M</em> function as a function of the size of the datasets.</p>
<p>The layout of the article is as follows.
The two first sections present the <em>M</em> function and the necessary data generated for the tests.
Large point sets (of the order of several tens of thousands of points) that are either completely random or geographically concentrated are drawn.
The third section details the use of the <em>dbmss</em> package to calculate the <em>M</em> function and its confidence interval from a table giving the position and characteristics of the points or a matrix of distances between them.
The fourth section measures the performance of <em>dbmss</em> as a function of the size of the set of points, in terms of computing time and memory requirements.
The fifth section tests the approximation which consists of grouping them together at the centre of the cells of a grid, following the approach of <span class="citation">Tidu et al. (2024)</span> which positions them at the centre of the administrative units in which they are located.
In the last section, we conclude and discuss the advantages and the limits of an approximation of the locations on the results as well as on the computing time.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The <em>M</em> function</h1>
<div id="main-idea" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Main idea</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Marcon &amp; Puech (2010)</span> introduced the <em>M</em> function that evaluates the dependence between geolocalized points without relying on a specific zoning of space.
As any distance-based methods, the calculation of <em>M</em> is based on distances that separate entities under study (establishment, shops…).
The idea of the <em>M</em> function is simple: it compares two proportions of neighbours of interest, a local one to a global one.
The local one is defined as the proportion of neighbours of interest within a distance <em>r</em>.
The global one is the same proportion but defines on the whole territory.
This comparison of ratios allows the detection of:</p>
<ul>
<li>spatial concentration (attraction) of entities if the proportion of local neighbours is greater than the one observed on the entire territory,</li>
<li>spatial dispersion (repulsion) of entities if the relative proportion of local neighbours is lesser than the one observed all over the territory,</li>
<li>independence between entities if the local distribution of neighbours does not differ from the global one.</li>
</ul>
<p>This comparison of proportions of neighbours defines <em>M</em> as a <em>relative</em> distance-based measure in a strict sense <span class="citation">(Marcon &amp; Puech, 2017)</span>.
The term <em>topographic</em> distance-based measures is preferred for those which used the surface area as a benchmark, as the well-known Ripley’s <em>K</em> function <span class="citation">(Ripley, 1976, 1977)</span>.
Lastly, the <em>M</em> function is a <em>cumulative</em> distance-based method because the local environment is defined within a distance <em>r</em> and not at a distance <em>r</em>.</p>
<p>The possibility to detect exactly at which distance(s) the spatial concentration or dispersion appears coupled with the interpretation of the results open the way to describe very precisely the distribution of entities under study.
Moreover, an easy-computation of <em>M</em> is possible thanks to the <em>dbmss</em> R package <span class="citation">(Marcon et al., 2015)</span>.
The <em>M</em> function was at first introduced in the field of economics and <span class="citation">Marcon &amp; Puech (2010)</span> proved that <em>M</em> satisfies all of the requirements of <span class="citation">Duranton &amp; Overman (2005)</span> for the evaluation of spatial distribution of industries.
Since its introduction, various studies have described the spatial locations of industries by using <em>M</em> ; for example, <span class="citation">Jensen &amp; Michel (2011)</span> study the location of shops at a urban level, <span class="citation">(<strong>CollMartinez2019?</strong>)</span> analyse the one of the creative industries at a metropolitan level etc.
This methodology has also rapidly been applied in other sciences including biology <span class="citation">(<strong>Fernandez2005?</strong>)</span>, geography <span class="citation">(Deurloo &amp; De Vos, 2008)</span>, ecology <span class="citation">(Marcon et al., 2012)</span> or seismology <span class="citation">(Nissi et al., 2013)</span>.
The <em>M</em> function is now included in general textbooks of spatial statistics as in <span class="citation">Arbia et al. (2021)</span>, but it is less popular than <span class="math inline">\(K_d\)</span>’s function of <span class="citation">Duranton &amp; Overman (2005; see <strong>Chain2019?</strong>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="definition" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Definition</h2>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> function is based on the point process theory <span class="citation">(Baddeley et al., 2016; Møller &amp; Waagepetersen, 2004)</span>.
This distance-based method has been developed to analyse interactions among entities in a context of heteregeneous space.
It means that within this statistical framework, we consider that any entity analysed has not the same probability to locate everywhere on the territory (<em>first-order intensity property of the point pattern</em>).
Then after controlling for space heterogeneity, we are able to identify interactions and thus detect spatial concentration or dispersion (<em>second-order intensity property of the point pattern</em>).
Controlling for space heterogeneity is a consistent assumption for studying agglomeration of industries (see discussion of <span class="citation">Duranton &amp; Overman (2005)</span> on that subject).</p>
<p>The definition of the <em>M</em> function it as follows.
It compares the relative proportion of entities of interest up to each distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to the same ratio but defined over the entire territory under study.
In the present article, we only consider the intra-type version of <em>M</em>: we study the spatial structure of neighbouring points of the same type (called <em>points of interest</em>) as the point at the centre of the disks of radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.
In a mathematical terms, let us denote:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x^s_i\)</span>, the geolocalised position of point <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of the reference type <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, at the centre of the disk (the point at which the neighbourhood is to be analyzed),</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x^s_j\)</span>, the geolocalised position of a neighbour of interest <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> of the same type as point <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span>, the geolocalised of a neighbour <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, whatever its type,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w(.)\)</span>, the weight of a given neighbour. In that sense, <span class="math inline">\(w(x_j)\)</span> defines the weight of a neighbor <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(W_s\)</span>, the total weight of the points <span class="math inline">\(x^s_j\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, the total weight of all points of the dataset, whatever their type,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\({\mathbf 1} \left( \left\| x^s_i - x_j \right\| \le r \right)\)</span>, the indicator function equal to 1 if <span class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span> is in the neighbourhood of <span class="math inline">\(x^s_i\)</span>, e.g., the distance between <span class="math inline">\(x^s_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span> is at most equal to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, 0 otherwise.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\({\mathbf 1} \left( \left\| x^s_i - x^s_j \right\| \le r \right)\)</span>, the indicator function equal to 1 if the distance between <span class="math inline">\(x^s_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^s_j\)</span> is at most equal to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, 0 otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The intra-type <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> function is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:M">\[
  \hat{M}\left(r\right) = {\sum_i{\frac{\sum_{j \ne i}{{\mathbf 1} \left( \left\| x^s_i - x^s_j \right\| \le r \right) w \left( x^s_j \right)}}{\sum_{j \ne i}{{\mathbf 1} \left( \left\| x^s_i - x_j \right\| \le r \right) w \left( x_j \right)}}}} / {\sum_i{\frac{W_s - w \left( x^s_i \right)}{W - w \left( x^s_i \right)}}}
  \tag{1.1}
\]</span></p>
<p>A certain number of remarks has to be done.
The first one is that the benchmark value of <em>M</em> is equal to 1, whatever the distance considered.
It means that for any given radius <em>r</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the estimated <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> result is above 1, the local value of the ratio is greater than the global one:,a spatial concentration of entities of type <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> within that radius is thus detected.</li>
<li>if the estimated <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> result is under 1, the local value of the ratio is lesser than the global one: a spatial dispersion of entities of type <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> within that radius is thus detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second remark concerns the significance of the results.
A confidence interval can be generated thanks to Monte Carlo simulations following <span class="citation">Marcon &amp; Puech (2010)</span>.
A risk level has to be chosen (for example 5%) as well as the number of simulations (the greater the number of simulations, the longer is the duration of the calculation of <em>M</em>).
Third, the package <em>dbmss</em> <span class="citation">(Marcon et al., 2015)</span> on the R software <span class="citation">(R Core Team, 2024)</span> can be used to compute the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> function.
The Euclidean distance is generally preferred for the calculation of <em>M</em> but the <em>dbmss</em> package also proposed to used network-distances.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Point pattern</h2>
<p>The <code>Mhat()</code> function in the <em>dbmss</em> package is used to estimate the <em>M</em> function.
The theoretical reference value for <em>M</em> is 1, as this function relates the proportion of Cases up to a distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to that observed over the entire window.
The aggregation of Cases will be highlighted by values of <em>M</em> greater than 1 (the relative presence of Cases is greater locally than over the whole window) and the dispersion of Cases by values less than 1.
We observe (figure <a href="#fig:MFig">3.1</a>) that <em>M</em> detects an agglomeration of Cases, which is in line with the simulation of this type of point (the controls having a completely random location on the window).
The advantage of a function based on distances is clearly visible: it allows us to detect exactly at which distance(s) the attraction phenomena occur and are the most important (for functions whose values can be compared at different radii, such as <em>M</em>).
In addition to estimating the <em>M</em> function, the <code>Menvelope()</code> function can be used to calculate its global confidence interval <span class="citation">(Duranton &amp; Overman, 2005)</span> under the null hypothesis of random point location.
It allows parallezing the necessary simulations.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Computing time</h2>
<p>Calculating the distances between all pairs of points is necessary to estimate <em>M</em>.
The calculation time is therefore expected to increase as the square of the number of points.
The calculation time required for the exact calculation is evaluated for a range of numbers of points (figure <a href="#fig:TestTimeMemFig">4.1</a>a).</p>
<p><strong>The calculation time is related to the size of the set of points by a power law.</strong> It increases less quickly than the square of the number of points.
It can be estimated very precisely (<span class="math inline">\(R^2=\)</span> 0.98) by the relation <span class="math inline">\(t=t_0 (n/n_o)^p\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the estimated time for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points (e.g.: 5.42 seconds for 100,000 points) knowing the time <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> points and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the power relation (here: 1.7).</p>

<p>Clearly, approximating the position of the points results in a loss of information: in each grid cell, the distance between all the points is set to zero, and the distance between two points in different cells is approximated by the distance between the centroids of the two cells.
We therefore expect a severe error in the estimation of <em>M</em> on a small scale (of the order of magnitude of the size of the cells) and an error that decreases with distance, when the relative size of the cells decreases.

<div id="discussion-and-conclusion" class="section level1" number="6">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Discussion and conclusion</h1>
<p>Our results are in line with <span class="citation">Tidu et al. (2024)</span>’s article, which mentions strong correlations between <em>M</em> values computed from exact and approximated Italian company location data.
Since the spatial structure of their data is probably an intermediate case between the two cases dealt with in our article (aggregated and random theoretical distributions), the results provided by our two contributions are complementary.</p>
<p>The computation burden of estimating the <em>M</em> function on large datasets may be an issue.
The calculation time for <em>M</em> is around 5 seconds for a set of 100,000 points on a laptop (Intel i7-1360P 2.20 GHz processor), and requires 25 MB of RAM.
Calculating a confidence interval from 1,000 simulations therefore takes less than two hours.
For a set of five million points, the power law predicts around an hour of computing time.
1,000 simulations would then take more than one month.
Thanks to parallelization, a calculation server would drastically increase performance, but at the cost of a complexity of implementation that limits its use.
If we limit ourselves to the computing power of a personal computer, <strong>exact calculation is fully justified for data of the order of <span class="math inline">\(10^5\)</span> points</strong>: a few hours are enough to calculate confidence intervals.
Since parallelizing the simulations is offered with no effort by the <em>dbmss</em> package, this time can be reduced by a factor depending on the available hardware, say 2 to 6 with modern multicore CPU’s.</p>
<p>Beyond that, approximating the location reduces the size of the set of points to the number of locations selected.
Again, it may be up to <span class="math inline">\(10^5\)</span> locations to keep computing time acceptable, whatever the size of the original dataset.
The choice of the size of the grid <span class="citation">(or the administrative scale of the aggregation of points in Tidu et al., 2024)</span> must be done according to the scale of the interactions under study: they can not be characterized correctly at distances below it.</p>
<p>So, <strong>approximation on location can be considered to save computation time, given the strong correlation observed between the values of <em>M</em> on exact and approximated data, but the scale of the grid must be fine enough to be informational at small distances</strong>.
Choosing the approximation scale is a tradeoff between accuracy, i.e. a small distance threshold above which results are accurate, and speed with a coarse grid.</p>
